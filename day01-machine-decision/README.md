Day 01 – How a Machine Makes a Decision

## Motivation
Before machine learning, intelligent systems relied on rules.
This project explores how a machine can make decisions using logic.

## What I Built
- A simple rule-based decision system
- Inputs: temperature and humidity
- Output: system action

## AI Insight
Rule-based systems are foundational in AI.
Understanding them is essential before learning-based models.

## Why This Matters
Many real-world AI systems still combine rules with learning.
This builds intuition for decision-making logic.

## Tools
- Python
- Conditional logic
