# Day 02 – AQI Scoring-Based AI System

## Motivation
Air pollution is a major public health issue in many Indian cities.
This project explores how AI systems can quantify environmental
risk using a continuous scoring approach.

## Problem
Given an AQI (Air Quality Index) value, determine the level
of health risk instead of assigning rigid categories.

## Approach
Instead of fixed AQI buckets, the system converts AQI into
a normalized risk score between 0 and 1.

## AI Insight
Scoring-based systems represent an evolution from early
rule-based expert systems toward machine learning models.

## Why This Matters
Continuous scoring allows smoother decisions and better
risk interpretation, which is essential in real-world AI systems.

## Tools
- Python
- Numerical reasoning
